# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
For the first project to myself, I do not have wild ambitious. Just wanna build up the foundation,
To get a better understanding of SQL and Github. 
Can analysis data problem by myself independently.

## Process
### First to learn how to build database and setup Github

### Second is to learn how to import csv file to pgAdmin

### Third one is to read and understand the data. Cross check every tables and each columns to make a clearly understanding about each data's meaning

### Fourth one is to clean the data from the raw materials and trying to figure out what kind of data should be kept 

### Fiveth is to analysis the data. Find out the relations between each columns and tables. 

### Last one is to QA the data, compared with raw data and the cleaned data. To make sure what you did is meaningful.

## Results
- Not every single column has the specific meaning, it sometimes indicates the data from that column is confused. 
- The product price is not make sense at the very first begining and the number is too big to be re-organized.


## Challenges 
- There is no clearly definitions for each columns. Some of them is obviously to understand, but some are really hard to get the point to analysis. Too many subtitles, it is bit a challenges to find out all the relations between those ones.

## Future Goals
- This is a really challenge project for me as the first SQL project. Too many SQL language knowledge and logical query sentence require time to digest and absorb. 
- If I got more time, I need more practice and review all the data, trying to find more connections between each numbers and analysis more complicated scenarios.
- All the process I did for this project is very rough, could be need more detailed and polished. Even with a weekend's worth of time, it can still be too short for a complete beginner to effectively execute a SQL project. Hope I have more time to overcome this challenge and strengthen my leaning ability in the future.
